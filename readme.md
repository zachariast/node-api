# Node Rest API

A simple REST API using express and mongoDB to start building your awesome API.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the dependencies of the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zachariast/node-express-api.git simple-api-example
cd simple-api-example && npm i
```

## Usage

1.  !In the root this repository you will find a file named .env.example
2.  Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just .env
3.  The file .env is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
4.  Change the values of the file to your environment (development or production)
5.  Upload the .env to your environment server(development or production)
